## The beauty and joy of computing (BJC)  
**Dan Garcia**

# Lecture 1  
## Welcome, Abstraction  

**Abstraction:**
- Detail removal: eg: shows only specific path on a map, remove the detail complexity
- Genralization: generalize the recipe for milk shake  
=> then specify the detail for choco milk shake/strawberry milk shake/vanilla milk shake

Function: think about what inputs make sense to use so you don't have to duplicate code

The power of abstraction: one of the big ideas of computing  
It is how mankind has engineered some of the greatest structures and managed the complexity  
  
Above the abstraction line: we only need to worry about the interface or specification or contract  
Abstraction Barriers (Interface)  
Below the abstraction line: this is where/how/when/by whome it is actually built, no need to worry
