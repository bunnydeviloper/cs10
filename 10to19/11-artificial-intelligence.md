## Artificial Intelligence

**What is AI?**
- The science of making machine that thinks like human/rationally, act like human/rationally
- AI history: big ideas, brittle rules break down in the real world, probability and uncertainty
- Big Data vs formal logic vs machine learning vs artificial intelligence

**AI Techiniques**
- Logic, search and planning, machine learning
> "A program learns if, after an experience, it performs better." Tom Mitchell, CMU
- Algorithm types: 
1. supervised learning (give organized data)
2. unsupervised learnning (give a bunch of data)
3. reinforcement learning (real-time corrextions adjust)

Eg: neural network trained to recognized digits in handwriting

**AI Applications**
- Speech texhologies (Siri, Google, Alexa, text-to-speech...
- Language processing technologies: machine translation, web search, spam filters...
- Vision (perception): panorama pictures, color scale/filter...
- Robotics
