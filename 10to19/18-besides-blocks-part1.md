**Why Learn Python?**
- Computational Thinking: using abstraction, understanding 'spec', iterative design cycle, scalable solutions, parallelize, generalize, foresee unintended consequences

- Installation
- Basics
- Turtle
- Numbers: ints and floats (numbers w/ decimals), Strings/Text, List [a,b,c], Index start w/ 0
- Variable, no need to 'declare', just use =, to access a variable, type its name
- conditional, indentation matters!, to end a condition, just un-indent your code, equals check is ==
- For loop, while loop, for a in range (range() is a func that includes the first item but not the last)
- Functions: use 'def' to define, (arguments), and can 'return None', or just 'return', call a function
