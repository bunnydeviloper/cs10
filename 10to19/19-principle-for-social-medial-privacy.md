## Principles for Social Media Privacy

- Your information footprint is larger than you think
- There is no anonymity on the internet
- Your information is not safe, it will be use by somebody, either for you or against you
- Communication over a network, unless strongly encrypted, is never just b/w two people

Quiz: which of the following technology help with that principle?
1. firewalls
2. https
3. anonymity Proxy (like Tor)
4. cookie blocker
5. routers
Correct: B

- Sharing information over a network means you give up control over that information, forever!
- Nothing is ever deleted, just b/c sth can't be found today doesn't mean it can't be found tomorrow
- The online world is inseparable from the 'real' world
- Identity is not guaranteed in the internet
- You can't avoid information footprint by not going online
- Only you have an interest in maintaining your privacy
