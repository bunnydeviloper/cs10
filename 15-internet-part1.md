Net Neutrality: unfair to charge people in the fast lane

**Internet History**

**Internet: How it Works**
- Internet of things (everything), connects devices and networks all over the world
- End-to-end architecture: the middle is "dumb", it doesn't care about what it is, it just need to deliver
- IP address (internet protocol) (protocols = agreements on standards)
- DNS (domain name system): translates names to IP addresses
- FTP (files transfer protocols), HTTP (hypertext transfer protocols), SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
- IPv4: support 7B people, IPv6: support 2^128 addresses, that's a lot for the next 100 years

**Internet Applications**
- Change the way people react
- The full flow:
  * Alece composes email to bob@bob.org
  * DNS looks up where bob.org is, return IP address of bob.org
  * DNS connect with the mail exchange server for bob.org
  * Mai is sent to mx.bob.org
  * Bob reads email from there
- WWW (world wide web): system of interlinked internet hypertext documents
- 2000 Dot-com bubble burst, Search and Browser: 1993, The Social Network (2004)
