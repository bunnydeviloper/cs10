HOUR OF CODE: START PROGRAMMING
~~~~~ GETTING TO KNOW YOU ~~~~~
1. What is your name?
"sophia"

2. Discover the length
"sophia".length

3. Basic Math
3+4

4. Numbers and more
You can use the command line to do basic math operations: + - / * %

5. Error: does not compute!
Try to confuse the interpreter by using a word it doesn''t know, like eggplant.
It will give you a ReferenceError: eggplant is not defined

~~~~~ WHY LEARN PROGRAMMING? ~~~~~
6. Editor and comments
Anything after a // is called a comment and is ignored by the computer.
You can also temporarily disable lines of code by commenting them out, or adding // in front of them

7. What am I learning?
What can we use JavaScript for?

 make websites respond to user interaction
 build apps and games (e.g. blackjack)
 access information on the Internet (e.g. find out the top trending words on Twitter by topic)
 organize and present data (e.g. automate spreadsheet work; data visualization)

8. Interactive JavaScript
confirm("I feel awesome!");
=> pop up box, similar to alert
=> this expression will return true

9. What is programming?
Programming is like writing a list of instructions to the computer so it can do cool stuff with your information.

To do any of these actions, the program needs an input. You can ask for input with a prompt.

prompt("What is your name?")
=> this expression will return the value of user''s input

10. Data Types I & II: Numbers and Strings
a. numbers are quantities, just like you''re used to. You can do math with them. >> withnout quotes
b. strings are sequences of characters, like the letters a-z, spaces, and even numbers >> with "quotes"

11. Data Type III: Booleans
A boolean can have only two values, true or false

~~~~~ MAKE THE COMPUTER THINK! ~~~~~
12. Using console.log
This is commonly called printing out.
console.log(2 * 5)
console.log("Hello")

13. Comparisons
List of comparison operators:
> Greater than
< Less than
<= Less than or equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
=== Equal to
!== Not equal to

14. Decisions, Decisions
You can use comparisons plus booleans to decide whether a block of code should run.
This is called an if statement or conditional statement.

if ( 100 > 2 ){console.log("You are good at math!");}

15. Computers are smart
if ( 7 > 9 )
{ alert("Let's go down the first road!");}
else
{    // What should we do if the condition is false? Fill in here:
    console.log('Check your math again!');}

16. Computers aren''t that smart
Syntax needs to be in exactly the right place for the computer to understand the code () {} [] ; , ...

~~~~~ MID-LESSON BREATHER ~~~~~
17. Mid-lesson breather [review]

~~~~~ VARIABLES ~~~~~
18. Variables
declare a variable:
var varName = "data";

19. More variable practice
var myName = "Steve Jobs";
myName.substring(0,5)
>> "Steve Jobs".substring(0,5) >> Steve
