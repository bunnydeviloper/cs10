## Functions

Functional Programming: breaking problems into smaller ones
Machine: take in 0 or more inputs, return exactly 1 output  
Same inputs MUST yield same outputs (Quiz: Pick random is NOT a function)  
No state (prior history), no mutation (no variables get modified), no side effects (nothing else happens)  

Data types  
Domain (input): the "class" of input a function accepts  
Range (output): all possible return values of a function  

Why should you use functions?  
- They allow for generalization of code!
- The building blocks of our program
- They can be composed together
- Breaking problems down into smaller ones
- It can run on any computer and get the same answer
- Makes it easy to parallelize computation: write software that runs on multiple systems at the same time

Recursion: technique for defining functions that use themselves to complete their own definition  
eg: recursion in screen recording program
