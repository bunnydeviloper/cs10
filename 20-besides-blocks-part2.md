## Besides Blocks II: Python Data Structures and APIs

**Python Objects and Sequences**
- Everything is an object, just like OOP from Programming paradigms
  * import <module>
  * to call, use dot notation: module.function
- Sequences: string, list, range, ordered set of data
- len(), min(), max(), map(), filter(), reduce(), count()...

**Python Strings, Lists, Tuples and Ranges**
- Tuples mostly like List except (), not [] 
(this imutability will be helpful in dictionaries)

**Python Dictionaries(dict)**
- Very fast access (by key, not by number)
- "Map" from a key to a value
(just like object in JS)

Quiz: we sae a series of "is a particular student here" problems when the students were unsorted, sorted, and give-months-in-advance. What running time did a dictionary-like structure help us attain?
a. exponential, b. quadratic, c. linear, d. logarithmic, e. constant
Correct: E

**Python HOFs and APIs**
- API (Application programming interface): set of agreements for sharing information
- Programming APIs: math, string, modules...
- Web APIs: "special" URLs for accessing data directly
- Eg: Jeopardy API, Tic Tac Toe, draw snowflake with turtle...
