## Data and Information

**Data and Information**
- It's a collaborative process
- Big data concerns: storing, processing, curating, structuring, maintaining privacy, scalability, analytical techniques
- ubiquitous data: data is collected any moment of your life

Quiz: What do you think is the biggest data overall?
a. text, b. images, c. DNA, d. videos, e. census data
Correct: D

**Big Data, Compression, Metadata**
- Storage: multiple hard disk/memory unit, need to parallelize harddisks, face all the problems of concurrent programming
(how to access data, what if a disk fails, speed, physical limits: energy cooling)

- Lossless compression: reduce data volume by removing redundant information, this compression is reversible (decompression) but has mathematically proven limits (AAAABBBBBCC -> 4A5B2C) (doesn't work for ABCABC -> 1A1B1C1A1B1C)
- Lossy Compression: reduces data volume by removing irrelevant information, not fully reversible but only has perceptual limits (JPEG)
- Metadata: Data about data
- Digital data: can be copied w/o loss, and sent instantly, permanently to everyone, privacy, security
- Big Digital Data: analyzing data at internet-scale helps understand the world on never-seen-before-scale

**Data: Conclusions and Visualization**
- Internet data is biased -> draw conclusions too quickly, sometimes *finding the ? to ask* is the hard part
- Correlation does not imply causality!
- Benefit of visualization: interactivity with data is an aspect of communicating
