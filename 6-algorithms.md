## Algorithms

**Algorithms: Definitions**
- Definition: precise sequences of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages
- Back in the old days: basket weaving is an algorithm
- Luhn algorithm: credit card number validation
- Deflate: Lossless data compression
- PageRank: Google's way to measure web page "reputation"
- EdgeRank: Facebook's way to determin news feed sort

- Building blocks of algorithms: sequencing (in order), selection (use boolean, if stmt), iteration (repeat), recursion (call itself)

Quiz: which of the following is false?
a. Algorithms can be worth billions of $ (google's search engine)
b. Paul Revere practiced selection
c. You learned your first algorithm before you could speak (if you're hungry => cry)
d. Proving algorithms are correct is easy
e. Algorithms can adapt, like a living thing (deep learning and AI)
Correct: D

**Algoirthms: Properties, Expressing**
- Properties: algorithms can be combined
- Use existing correct algorithms to help ensure the new algorithm is correct
- Algorithms need to be expressed in a context-free, unambifuous way (loaf of bread and dozen egg story, PB&J sandwich)
- Languages for algorithms: pseudo code, visual and text-based programming languages
- Algorithms are conceptual definitions of how to accomplish a task. (written in pseudo code)
- Functin or procedure is an implementation of algorithm (written in programming languages)
- CLARITY & READABILITY are important

**Algorithms: Turing Completeness**

**Summary**
- We're constantly dealing with trade-offs when selecting/building algorithms.
- Each paradigm language has its unique benefits
