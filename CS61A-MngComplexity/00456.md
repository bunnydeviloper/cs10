* the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...
* fibonacci spiral
* designing functions
* characteristics of fn: domain (inputs), range (outputs), behaviors (relationship b/w I/O)
* guide: DOT (do-one-thing), DRY (dont-repeat-yourself), define fn generally (solve many problems of one kind)
* generalization (compute area of square, cirlce, and hexagon)
* assert statement: assert 3 > 2, "Math is broken" // if true, nothing happens, if false, print message
* higher-order functions
  1. functions that takes other functions as arguments
  2. functions as a return values
* locally defined fn
* compound operator: makeAdder(3)(2012) // 2015

# Lecture 5: 01.30.2015
* environments enable higher order functions
* eg: applyTwice(square, 3) => 81, squipple(5) => 225 // squipple = compose(square, tripple)
* environments for nested functions
* local names
* lambda expressions: `square = lambda x: x * x`
* eg: `squipple = compose(lambda x: x*x, lambda x: 3*x)`

# Lecture 6: 02.02.2015
* recursive functions: a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly
  * eg: digit sums for CC numbers (Luhn algorithm)
* the anatomy of a recursive function:
  1. def header (function declaration)
  2. base cases (conditional statement)
  3. recursive calls (each call solve a simpler problem than the last)
* recursion in environment diagram
* factorial
* iteration vs recursion
  * iteration is a special case of recursion
* Luhn algorithm
