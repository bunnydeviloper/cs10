# Lecture 7: 02.04.2015
* order of recursive calls
* the cascade function
* tree recursion
* counting partitions: counting different ways of making n using parts upto size m (coin example)


# Lecture 8: 02.06.2015
* abstraction: (ignore the details)
* functional abstraction
* intrinsic name: a name it was assigned when it originated
* choosing names
  1. name should convey the meaning or purpose
  2. put the type of value bound to the name in the docstrings
  3. function names typically convey their effect (print), their behavior (tripple), or the value return (abs)
    * n, k, i: usually integers
    * x, y, z: usually real numbers
    * f, g, h: usually functions
* testing, TDD (test-driven development)
  * write the test before you write the fn (clarify domain, range, behaviors)
  * develop incrementally before moving on (can't depend on code that hasn't been tested)
  * run old tests again after making new changes
  * use tests to run your code interactively
* function decorators: @trace, same thing as square = trace(square)
* currying: transform a multi-argument function into a single-argument function, higher-order function

# Lecture 9: 02.11.2015
* data abstraction: let us manipulate compound values as a unit
  * compound values combine other values together (eg: date, maps location)
  * greate programmers: think about isolate: how data are represented and how data are manipulated (use)
* rational numbers
  * exact representation: integers, fractions (eg: 3/2, 4/3...)
  * approximation: float (0.3333, 0.3337)
* pairs:
  * representing pairs using lists (list literal [1,2,3,4])
  * "unpacking" a list (kinda like object destructuring in JS)
  * selection operator (index)
  * construction
* abstraction barriers
  * break things down into smaller chunks so it's easier to change later
* data representations
* demo:
  ```py
  def rational(n, d):
      def select(name):
          if name == 'n':
              return n
          elif name == 'd':
              return d
      return select

  def numerator(x):
      return x('n')
  def denominator(x):
      return x('d')
  ```
