# Lesson 10: 02.13.2015
* sequences (has length and index for elemnet selection)
  * the sequence abstraction
  * lists are sequences
  * `for each in myList:`
  * sequence unpacking (unpacking a nested list)
  * the range type: a range is a sequence of consecutive integers
    * range(-2, 2) // lower bound is inclusive, upper bound is exclusive
    * range(4) is same as range(0, 4)
* list comprehensions: use a list or sequence and create some new list/sequence
  ```py
  letter = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p']
  [letter[i] for i in [3, 4, 6, 8]
  # this will return ['d', 'e', 'm', 'o']

  odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
  [x+1 for x in odds]
  # this will return [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
  [x for x in odds if 25 % 5 == 0]
  # this will return [1, 5]

  def divisors(n):
      """Returns the integers that evenly divide n.
      return [1] + [x for x in range(2, n) if n%x==0]
  print(divisors(10)) # [1, 2, 5]

  [n for n in range(1000) if sum(divisor(n)) == n]
  # this will return [1, 6, 28, 496]
  ```
* strings and strings abstraction
* dictionaries {"Dem": 0}
  ```py
  dict([('v', 4), ('x', 6)])
  # this will return {'v': 4, 'x': 6}
  dict([('v', 4), ('x', 6)])['v']
  # this will return 4
  {x: x*x for x in range(4)}
  # this will return {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
  {x: x*x for x in range(4)}[3]
  # this will return 9
  ```

# Lesson 11: 02.18.2015
* Box-and-pointer notation
  * the closure property of data types
  * membership (`in` and `not in` operator) and slicing (to get sub-sequences)
    * note: slicing creates a new object
* trees
  * a tree as a root value and a sequence of branches
  * each branch is a tree
  * a tree with 0 branches is called a leaf
  * nodes/ node values: the root values of subtrees within a tree
* tree processing with recursion

* TODO; make sure to do tree exercise
  * tree, root, branches, is_tree, is_leaf
  * fib_tree, partition tree
