# What is an algorithms and why should you care?

* algorithms: set of steps to complete a task
  * video and audio compression algorithm (video hangout)
  * route finding algorithm (google maps)
  * rendering algorithm (Pixar color 3D model)
  * optimization and scheduling algorithm (nasa rearrange solar panel in space)
  * minimax algorithm (checkers game)
* What makes a good algorithm?
  1. Correctness (it solved the problem)
  2. Efficiency (fast enough)
* How do you measure efficiency? --> Asymptotic analysis
  * allows algorithms to be compared independently of a particular programming language (C, python...)
  * or hardware (PC, mac...) so that we can say one algorithm is more efficient than another
