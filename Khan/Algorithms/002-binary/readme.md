# Binary search
* Eg: search for a star in a glossary book of 2M stars

### Implementing binary search of an array
* search for a prime number in an array of primes:

### Challenge: binary search

### Running time of binary search
* base-2 logarithm of n
* log(base-2) n = x then n = 2(power)x
* runtime of binary search algorithm on an n that is exactly a power of 2: **log(base-2)n + 1**

### Practice: running time of binary search
