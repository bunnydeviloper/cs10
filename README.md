**Code Wisdom**
> RTFM!!!

> DRY: don't repeat yourself

> The best way to learn is to teach. 

> "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve, until they actually did it." - Patrik M.

> "A primary cause of complexity is that the software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want." - Niklaus W.

> "One of the best programming skills you can have is knowing when to walk away for a while." - Oscar G.

> "Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file." - Louis S.

> "The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability." - Randall S.

> "First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack.” - George C.

  * No **significant learning** can occur withouth a **significant relationship**. - Dr. James Comer
  * I am **SOMBODY**. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave. I am **powerful**, and I am **strong**. I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to **DO**, people to **IMPRESS**, and places to **GO**. ~~ And they said **"YEAH!"** ~~ *You say it long enough, it starts to be **a part of you**.*
  * We come to work when we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway. We teach anyway because that's what we do.
  * Every child deserves a champion; an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best they can possibly be.
  * Is this job *tough*? You betcha! But it is **not impossible**. We're EDUCATORS, we're **born to make a difference**.

> If you are **not willing** to learn, no one can *help* you.   
If you are **determined** to learn, no one can *stop* you.  
(same goes with your diet :blush: and exercise :dolphin:)

> Leaders become great not because of their power but because of their ability to empower others.

> If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.

> If you don't go after what you want, you'll never have it.  
  If you don't ask, the answer is always no.  
  If you don't step forward, you're always in the same place.  
  
> You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. - Steve Jobs

> When given a choice between being right or being kind, choose kind. (Wonder movie)
