# Lesson 21
## Working with Browser Events

* Events = announcement; when sth happens to the browser, it makes an 'announcement'
* Event Listener: we use JS to listen for these 'announcement' and response to it

* `monitorEvents(document);` // start displaying all events on the document object
  * click, dblclick, scroll, resize...
* `unmonitorEvents(document);` // turn off the displaying of all events on the document object.

* Responding to an event - how to listen for an event and respond when one happens
* Event Data - harness the data that is included with an event
* Stopping an event - preventing an event from triggering multiple responses
* Event Lifecycle - the lifecycle stages of an event
* DOM Readiness - events to know when the DOM itself is ready to be interacted with

**Response to an event**
**Remove an event listener**
**Avoid too many events**
**Know when the DOM is ready**
