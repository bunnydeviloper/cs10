# Lesson 4: Learning a new codebase

### Interview: Gaining context
### Quiz: what's next?
### Exploring a new codebase
1. Run the application
2. Explore the file structure
3. Look at what js files are loaded
4. Figure out what the libraries do!

### Quiz: codebase quiz
### Getting the big picture of our library
### Interview: be tofu
* consistency within the code base is more important

### Exploring a codebase
### Quiz: modifying a feature
* Instruction: todo items that are shown as completed should show '--done' at the end
  * Is this change profound (change how data is stored)  or cosmetic (css)?
  * Where could this change be implemented? The view file, template, etc...
  * Is there anything like this already implemented?
* play detective: track down where the changes have been made, and then integrate new changes seemlessly into it

### Quiz: adding additional UI
* Instruction: the didt button should get a class of 'edit-btn'

### Quiz: adding a new feature
* Instruction: the priority button should get a class of 'priority-btn'

### More ideas
* Let the user set the priority status when creating the todo item
* Let users filter or sort by priority status
* Expand the priority feature to have more than two levels
* Add a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos
* Add colors, so people can associate different todos with each other
* Add labels for sorting and filtering

# Keep building things, keep implementing up, reading, learning, exploring
