### Walk-thru Backbone's 'Events.trigger'
### Quiz: Events quiz
* What will be logged for Jack's present?
  ```js
  jack.on('birthday', function(presents) {
    console.log('Buy a ' + presents);
  }
  jack.trigger('birthday', 'bycicle', 'sword', 'clarinet');
  // logs 'Buy a bycicle'
  // note: 'sword' and 'clarinet' were sent along with 'bycicle' into the cb fn, but they are not stored or used
  ```

### Quiz: build your own event system quiz
* check exercise

### A router and the Backbone.history object
### Quiz: routing quiz
```js
var MountainRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    '': 'home',
    'mountain/:id': 'mountain', // using id as single value
    'download/*brochure': 'download' //using a splat to capture anything after
  },

  home: function() {...},
  mountain: function() {...},
  download: function() {...}
});
```

### hashchange & pushState
* a common URL can be broken down into several parts
  1. `https://` - protocol
  2. `en.wikipedia.org` - domain
  3. `/wiki/Udacity` - path
  4. `#History` - fragment identifier (when this is changed, an event is fired but the page does not refresh)
* whenever the protocol, domain, or path changes, the whole page is refreshed with new content
* **hashChange**: the event that's fired when the fragment identifier is added or changed
  ```
  // in index.html
  <h1>New Page Heading</h1>
  <p>New page content. Lorem ipsum...</p>

  // In app.js: when the fragment changes, update the page's content with new data
  $(window).on('hashchange', function() {
      var newPageUrl = getFragmentIdentifier();
      $.get( newPageUrl, function( pageContents ) {
          $('#content').html( pageContents );
      })
  });
  // if our website were located at http://example.com/, changing the URL to http://example.com/#page.html will load the new page's content into #content element
  ```
* **pushState**: this method update the contents of the browser's history stack
  * `window.history.pushState(state, title, url);`
  * state: an object containing information of the new entry
  * title: string
  * url: string, relative or absolute URL, same origin as current page
  ```
  var state = { 'userId': 13579, 'secret': 'HTML5 is awesome' };
  var title = 'A secret page!';
  var url = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5';
  history.pushState(state, title, url);
  // the current URL will change to HTML5's url, but the page does not reload
  // the HTML5 URL is added to the history stack even though the page was never actually visited
  // if u navigate to another site, and then pressed the back button, the browser will actually load HTML5 page since that was the most recent location in history
  ```
* frameworks handle URL management using pushState is: they listen for clicks on links in the application, load new content into the page, and use pushState to update the URL to match the information the page is now displaying

### stepping thru Backbone.history.start()
### Quiz: Backbone's fragment count quiz
* `Backbone.History.start` sets the stage for when a URL changes. But it is the `checkUrl` that's in charge of these changes.
* when a url changes from
  * http://mountainsRus.com/ to http://mountainsRus.com/#mountain/42
  * Backbone's getFragment method was called twice
  * called once by checkUrl, and another time by loadUrl

### Quiz: lesson highlight summary quiz
### Outro
* frameworks are just JavaScript, there is no magic
* a framework is built with pieces of functionality
* underscore's template function = power house
