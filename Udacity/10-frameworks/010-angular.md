### The Angular Ecosystem
* Module component: container that stores different parts of an app
* View: templating system to format html of your app, directive
* Directive are markers on a template that tells the angular's html compiler to attach special behavior to DOM component
* Scope binds the template and the controller together, scope watches for change from the view and update the controller, and when the changes happen in the controller, then the template is updated
* Controller: set up initial state and logic for the view
* service: closely tie with controller, put view-independent logic in a service, sharing data, eg: a service can be used to fetch and stored user's object, one service can be used in multiple controllers (sharing data with other parts of the app)
* Router: managing states, watch the URL and load the correct template and controller
