# Lesson 4: Render UI with external data

### Introduction
* Lifecycle events: lifecycle events are methods in a component, which will be called at certain times (during the lifecycle of a component)
  * `componentWillMount`: invoked immediately **before** the component is **inserted** in the DOM
  * `componentDidMount`: invoked immediately **after** the component is **inserted** in the DOM
  * `componentWillUnmount`: invoked immediately **before** a component is **removed** from the DOM
  * `componentWillReceiveProps`: invoked whenever the component is **about to** receive brand new props
* `render()` is for rendering ONLY (displaying content only)
* data should not be fetched in the `render` method
