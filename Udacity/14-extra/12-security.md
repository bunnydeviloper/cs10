# Lesson 12: security

### Security intro
### Origins
* An origin is made up of three parts:
  * Data Scheme: `https://`
  * Hostname: `www.udacity.com`
  * Port: `:443`
* cross-origin fetch requests: you can make the request, but you just canNOT read the response

### Origins 2
* same-origin policy: browser-enforced, the client will NOT let you send off requests
* eg different resources:
  * you can't inspect a image within a canvas element
  * you can't see content of script tag that includes a cross-origin resource
