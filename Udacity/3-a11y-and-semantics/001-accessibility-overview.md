# Lesson 1
## Accessibility Overview

* (A11y) (there are 11 letters between the "A" and the "Y"
  * ("i18n" = "internationalization", "l10n" = "localization")
* broadly speaking: content can be access by ev1 and functionality can be operated by any1
* it's easy to assume other people use computer the same way you do (mouse, keyboard...)
* if not careful, you narrow your users and creates issues for anyone outside of that range
* design for users who may "experience" impairment (can be situational, temporary, or permanent)
* consider a11y at the START will ensure your final product is more polished and works well 4 ev1
* [project's Github Repo](https://github.com/udacity/ud891)
* in the end, it's NOT a zero sum game, by chosing to focus more on a11y, we make it better for ev1

**WCAG** Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: POUR
  * Perceivable: make sure user can perceive content
  * Operable: can user use UI components and navigate the content?
  * Understandable: is content and interface consistent enough to avoid confusion?
  * Robust: is content robust enough to be consumed by a wide variety of user agents?
    * Does it work with assistive technology?
