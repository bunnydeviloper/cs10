# Lesson 14 - Introduction to web tooling and automation

### Course Intro
* Introduction to using web tools such as Sass, Gulp, Sublime, Angular

### Quiz: cost effectiveness
* Which of the following optimizations are worth doing considering time and risk?
  1. 10% speed up in launching editor (takes 1 hour) -- No
  2. Post-process that tests your app on a mobile screen (takes 1 day) -- Yes
  3. An editor plugin that autocloses your HTML tags (takes 30 mins) -- Yes
  4. A script that generates images for hi-res devices (takes 4 hours) -- Yes

### Common sense
* not all optimization are worth doing
* you don't need to build things from scratch
* a new tool that's 20% faster doesn't mean it's better. Let the community evaluate it overtime. And also, the developer has to maintain the code base as well.
* don't just rely on your instinct, consider the long term value for your project
* a self contained/all in one package tool => run!, life is too short to depends on 1 tool
* if the app could *theoretically* fail under x,y,z scenario -> becareful with micro optimization
* make your investment wisely
