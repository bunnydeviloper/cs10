# Lesson 18: how to prevent disasters

### Lesson Intro
### Why rely on tolls to prevent bad things
### Linting
* Linting is a way to automatically check your JS code for errors
* Linting can be done at various stage during your development via editor, build process, or pre-commit hook in version control
  * code style linting (camelCase, brackets...)
  * syntax linting (structural) (JS anti-patterns, unreachable stmt, forgetting to do a strict comparison against null)
* Three popular JavaScript Linters: JSHint, JSCS, ESLint

### Quiz: How does linting help you
* YES - helps uncover code style problems

* NO - identifies incorrect return types

### Setting up ESLint
* Why ESLint? It supports ES6 syntax, can be extended, and has output that's easy to understand
