# Lesson 5: Ajax with XHR

### Course Intro
* GET request: an internet request for data. Sent fron a client to a server
* Response: a server's response to a request. Sent from a server to a client. A response to a GET request will usually include data that the client needs to load the page's content
* callback: you call them when you have a response back

### Ajax Definition & Examples
* Asynchronous JavaScript And XML request
* Asynchronous means it's non-blocking, you can do other things while waiting for the response
* AJAX response: Data: XML (`<entry></entry>`), JSON(`{prop: data}`), HTML (`<div></div>`)
* XML stores data, HTML presents it on a browser
