# Lesson 2
## Focus

* Focus refers to the control on the computer screen receives input from the keyboard and from the clipboard when you paste
* Not all elements are focusable (text, image...)
* in general, there's no need to focus sth if user can't interact with or provide some sort of input

* **Tab Order** (tab, shift tab, arrow keys)
* Tab order corresponds with DOM order (styling or visual changes, eg float:right, will not change DOM order)
* Navigation order should be logical and intuitive
