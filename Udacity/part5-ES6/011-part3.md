### WeakMaps
* WeakMap is just like normal Map with a few key differences:
  1. a WeakMap can only contain objects as keys,
  2. a WeakMap is not iterable which means it can’t be looped and
  3. a WeakMap does not have a .clear() method.
* Example:
  ```js
  const book1 = { title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen' };
  const book2 = { title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger' };
  const book3 = { title: 'Gulliver’s Travels', author: 'Jonathan Swift' };

  const library = new WeakMap();
  library.set(book1, true);
  library.set(book2, false);
  library.set(book3, true);

  console.log(library);
  // WeakMap {Object {title: 'Pride and Prejudice', author: 'Jane Austen'} => true,
  //          Object {title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger'} => false,
  //          Object {title: 'Gulliver’s Travels', author: 'Jonathan Swift'} => true}

  // …but if you try to add something other than an object as a key, you’ll get an error!
  // library.set('The Grapes of Wrath', false); // Uncaught TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key(…)

  // similar to WeakSets, WeakMaps leverage garbage collection for easier use and maintainability
  // If you set an object to null, then you’re essentially deleting the object.
  // And when collector runs, the memory that was occupied will be freed up to be used later

  book1 = null;
  console.log(library);
  // WeakMap {Object {title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger'} => false,
  //          Object {title: 'Gulliver’s Travels', author: 'Jonathan Swift'} => true}

  // WeakMaps is useful where u want an efficient, lightweight solution for creating groupings of objects with metadata
  ```

### Promises Intro
* using JS promise is the new way to handle asynchoronous requrest
* "do this thing now, and then notify me when it's done so i can pick up where i left off"

### Promises
* A JS Promise is created witht he new Promise constructor functin - `new Promise()`
* the argument of the constructor fn must be the code that will be run asynchronously
* Indicate a successful request (`resolve`) or a failed request (`reject`) (these are methods)
  ```js
  new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    window.setTimeout(function createSundae(flavor = 'chocolate') {
      const sundae = {};
      // request ice cream
      // get cone
      // warm up ice cream scoop
      // scoop generous portion into cone!
      if ( /* iceCreamConeIsEmpty(flavor) */ ) {
        reject(`Sorry, we're out of that flavor T__T`);
      }
      resolve(sundae);
      // when the promise is 'fulfilled', either resolved or rejected, data is sent back w/ response
    }, Math.random() * 2000);
  });
  ```
* Promise will immediately return an object, which has a `.then()` method on it
  * `.then()` method takes 2 fns:
    1. the fn to run if the request completed successfully
    2. the fn to run if the request failed to complete
  ```js
  const myPromiseObj = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      // sundae creation code
  });
  mySundae.then(function(sundae) {
      console.log(`Time to eat my delicious ${sundae}`);
  }, function(msg) {
      console.log(msg);
      // self.goCry(); // not a real method
  });
  ```
