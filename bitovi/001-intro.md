# Training Series - Basic JS

* why JS? build big and complex things with JS

* JS - a language
  * JS is dynamic: compilation and execution happen together
  * JS is weakly typed: type associated with VALUE, not variable
  * JS is prototype based: prototype looks up inherited and shared properties
  * JS has 1st class functions: treat like any object
  * Javascript != Java
  * Javascript != DOM
  * Javascript == ECMAScript == JScript

* HTML - a document format, hypertext markup language

* DOM - a language-neutral INTERFACE that allows programs to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents

* what happen when you type URL to browser?
  * -> browser send http request to server
  * -> server response with html string
  * -> html string is passed to DOM
  * -> DOM will parse the string -> read and build each element
  * -> reach script tag -> pass to JS engine
  * -> JS run the code
