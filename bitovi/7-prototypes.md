Training Series - Prototypes
.prototype and .protoÂ demystified! We'll cover what the "new" and "instanceof" operators are actually doing behind the scenes, and what prototype-based inheritance looks like in memory.
This week's agenda:
* Shared properties
* Methods/properties on a prototype
* Setting up the proto chain
* Object.create
* Exercise!
