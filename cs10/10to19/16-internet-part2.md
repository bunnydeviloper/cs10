## Internet II

- Background: heartbleed bug

**Internet: Hierarchical and Redundant**
- Hierarchical: helps systems scale (IP addresses are hierarchical)
- Redundant: there's more than 1 way to get somewhere, but it helps fault tolerance (reliable), and helps internet scale to more devices
- ISPs: internet service providers

**Internet: Widespread Growth, Use. How?**
- Open (= not owned by company) standards fuel the growth of the internet
- Standards for packets and routing (TCP/IP)
- Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and server on the web (HTTP, SSL/TLS)
- Packet-switched system: break data into blocks of bits called packets, which contains the data and control information for routing
- Bandwidth and latency: size and speed of systems
  * Bandwidth: a measure of bit rate (the amount of data that can be sent in a fixed time b/s)
  * Latency: time elapsed b/w the transmission and the receipt of a request (ms)

Quiz: What has the highest bandwidth?
1. wireless network 1.3 gbps
2. wired networks: 10gbps
3. your hard drive and your computer: 20gbps
4. your CPU and its scratch space: 128 gbps
5. a truck of microSD cards going next door: 177M gbps

**Internet: Cyber security**
