**Creativity: Introduction**

- Creativity and computing are prominent forces in innovation
- Creative development can be an essential process for creating computational artifacts

**Computational Artifacts**
- Computting enables people to create computational artifacts for creative expression or to solve a problem
- Computational artifact is created by a human using a computer, can be 3D model, videos, images...
- Createing computational artifacts requires understanding of and use of software tools and services
- computing tools and techniques are: IDEs, 3D printers, text editor

**Collaboration, Analysis, Power!**
- Collaboration is an essential part, enhance performance, multiple perspectives, diverse talents and skills
- Collaborative tools
- Effective collaborative teams  practice interpersonal communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, & negotiation
- we can analyze computational artifacts: correctness, usability, functionality, suitability... weakness, mistakes, or errors
- Computing extends traditional forms: digital audio and music, digital images, digital effects and animations, exploration of real and virtual phenomena
